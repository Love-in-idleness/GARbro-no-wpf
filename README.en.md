# GARbro

[简体中文](README.md) · **English** · [Русский](README.ru.md)

Open a game's resource archives, browse pictures, listen to audio, and extract the files you need. GARbro has a desktop interface and a command-line tool.

## Download and start

Choose a package from the [preview download page](https://github.com/Love-in-idleness/GARbro-no-wpf/releases/tag/v0.3.0-preview.2). Use **x64** for most Intel and AMD computers, or **arm64** for Windows on ARM, ARM Linux, and Apple silicon.

| System | Package | Open it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Windows | `win-x64.zip` or `win-arm64.zip` | Extract it and open `desktop/GARbro.Desktop.exe` |
| Windows installer | Matching `.msix` and `.cer` | Follow the [installation guide](docs/install.md) to trust the test certificate, then install the MSIX |
| Debian 13 / Ubuntu 24.04 | Matching `.deb` | Install it, then open GARbro from your application menu |
| Other Linux distributions | `linux-x64.tar.gz` or `linux-arm64.tar.gz` | Extract it and run `desktop/GARbro.Desktop` |
| macOS on Apple silicon | `osx-arm64.tar.gz` | Extract it and open `GARbro.app` |

These desktop downloads require the matching [.NET 10 Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/10.0). See the [installation guide](docs/install.md) for missing libraries or certificate prompts. Package filenames also contain the version number.

This is a preview: some games may not work yet. GARbro is not yet available on Flathub or the Microsoft Store, and Android development is on hold. The `store.msixupload` download is for Store submission; you do not need it to use GARbro.

## Using the desktop app

1. **Open a resource.** Drop files or a folder into the window, or use the **File** icon menu at the top right. Hover over an icon to see its menu name.
2. **Browse an archive.** Double-click a folder or recognized archive to enter it. Use Back, Forward, and Up in **View** to navigate.
3. **Preview files.** Select an image, text file, or audio file. Audio starts only when you press Play.
4. **Extract files.** Select files and press **F4**, or choose **Extract all** from **Process**. Pick an output folder, choose any image/audio conversion and existing-file options, then start.

Use **Process → Recursive extraction** to expand child directories and archives too. Archive creation and batch media conversion are also in **Process**.

If filenames or text look garbled, try GBK, Shift-JIS, or another encoding under **Settings → Decoding**. Settings also contains language, light/dark theme, and the default output folder. If an archive asks for a password or game scheme, supply the parameters for that game; some encryption methods are unsupported.

| Shortcut | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Ctrl+O | Open a file |
| Enter / Backspace | Open the selected item / go up one level |
| Alt+← / Alt+→ | Back / forward |
| Ctrl+A | Select all |
| F3 / F4 / F6 | Create archive / extract selected / convert media |
| F5 / Esc | Refresh / cancel the current task |

On macOS, Command can replace Ctrl in this table. See the [user guide](docs/manual.en-US.md) for more.

## Using the command line

The command-line tool is in the package's `cli` folder. Open a terminal there. The examples below use Linux/macOS syntax; in Windows PowerShell, replace `./garbro` with `.\garbro.exe`. Quote paths containing spaces.

```sh
# Show help
./garbro help

# List an unencrypted XP3 archive's contents
./garbro list "data.xp3" --scheme none

# Extract into the output folder
./garbro extract "data.xp3" --scheme none -o "output"

# Process a folder and expand nested archives
./garbro extract "game-data" --recursive --nested --scheme none -o "output"

# Convert a supported image to PNG
./garbro convert "image.tlg" -o "image.png"
```

`--scheme none` disables encryption schemes and works for unencrypted XP3 archives. Encrypted resources need the appropriate `--scheme` or `--options`. Use `--encoding gbk` or `--encoding shift_jis` for garbled filenames. Existing outputs cause a conflict by default; add `--overwrite skip` to skip them or `--overwrite replace` to replace them. Add `--json` when processing results in a script.

## Getting help

Start with the user guide and troubleshooting pages in **Help**. If you still need assistance, [open an issue](https://github.com/Love-in-idleness/GARbro-no-wpf/issues/new/choose) with the game name, file format, operating system, and steps to reproduce. **Help → Export logs** creates a diagnostic report you can attach. Do not publish passwords, keys, or game files you cannot share.
