# GARbro user guide

Install the .NET 10 Runtime before starting a portable or side-loaded GARbro package.
The Microsoft Store and Flatpak packages carry their runtime. Linux DEB installations also
need the native libraries listed in linux-desktop.md. Windows MSIX preview
packages use a test certificate; trust the certificate supplied with that release
before installing or upgrading. ZIP packages remain available.

The six outlined icon menus group File, Process, Selection, View, Settings and Help.
Hover over an icon for its name; every popup combines icons with text.

## Browse resources

Use File → Open or Open folder, or drop files and folders onto the window.
Double-click a folder or archive to enter it. Back, Forward and Up navigate
physical directories and nested archives. Loading only reads resources.
Use the search box, sorting menu, Select all or wildcard selection to choose files.
The context menu can assign a resource type when automatic identification needs
help. Show in file manager locates the outer physical file.

## Extract and convert

Extract all and Extract selected open an output dialog. Recursive extraction
also scans child directories and nested archives. Child archive copies remain
beside their filename.unpacked directories. Input files are never modified.
Choose conflict handling, resource types and optional conversion in the dialog.
Cancellation keeps completed files and removes unfinished temporary output.
Limits cover the whole recursive operation; increase them in Settings when needed.

Create archive uses the selected files/directories, or the current directory
when nothing is selected. Select a writable format and review its parameters.
Convert multimedia writes new image/audio files to the chosen destination.
Physical files can be moved to the operating system's recycle bin after confirmation.

## Preview

Images support original size and fit mode. Text and hexadecimal views have paging
and copy controls. Select GBK, Shift-JIS or another encoding in Settings if names
or text are garbled. Format-defined Unicode fields keep their defined encoding.
Audio selection shows metadata; click Play to prepare and play the audio.
Pause, Stop, position and volume controls are available. Switching files stops it.
Unsupported codecs report an error; registered formats do not imply every game
variant has been verified.

## Settings and help

The gear opens language, light/dark/system theme, encoding, output directory,
time/memory limits, viewer and format settings. Ordinary settings persist across
restarts. Passwords entered for decoding remain in the current session.
The question mark and Help menu provide the guide, diagnostics, licenses, updates,
log export and About. About lists registered formats and their declared read/write
capability; see compatibility.md for independently verified variants.
Update checks are manual. Application downloads open the project release page;
compatible format databases are checksum-checked before installation in your user
data directory. No reports or logs are uploaded automatically.

## Shortcuts

Ctrl+O: open. Ctrl+P: settings. Ctrl+Q: quit. F3: create archive.
F4: extract selected. F5: refresh. F6: convert. Enter: open selected.
Backspace / Ctrl+PageUp: parent. Alt+Left/Right: navigation history.
Ctrl+A: select all. Ctrl+C: copy selected filenames. Numpad +: select by wildcard.
Alt+Shift+T/M/S: toggle toolbar/menu/status bar. Alt restores a hidden menu.
Text fields and input methods retain their normal editing shortcuts.

## Flatpak

Use the system file picker to authorize files and output folders. Select the whole
source folder when a format needs sibling indexes or keys. The sandbox does not
provide a host recycle-bin command. See flathub.md for packaging validation status.
